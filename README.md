rock paper scissors games with opencv and python
This app can start the game after connecting via webcam
To run the game better, you have to lower your hand after showing one of the 3 modes so that it is not seen by the webcam.
Each time the hand is detected by the webcam, the computer randomly selects one of three modes, and according to the computer selection, the desired image is cut from the image and displayed.

The game continues until the "q" key is pressed and the winner and loser points are determined.

In case of equality, no points will be exchanged

To better teach the image part, cuts are used to use only one image for the game, instead you can use 3 separate images.
